# KrV Course (Next.Js)
Have you ever thought about reading Immanuel Kant's <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, but you are terrified by its sheer difficulty?
Or you are a philosophy student and this great work is not offered in the list of courses?
Then this e-learning site may be just what you need!

For my krv-course offers (when done) a comprehensive collection of lessons, quizzes and room for your own notes. (But it's all in German.)
You can register quickly to track your progress.

## Technologies
This is a React application built with Next.Js, TypeScript, Axios and Vite.

Go to the [backend](https://github.com/miob1781/krv-course-server) here.

## Website

The website is deployed on Netlify: https://kritik-der-reinen-vernunft.netlify.app.

I am looking forward to your feedback!
